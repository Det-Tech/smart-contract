A checklist based on the first Zeppelin audit (https://medium.com/@ZeppelinOrg/7ab67f85241e)

Burn boundaries could disable burning
 - done (sort of - added a sanity check, but also explicitly allow disabling burning)

Null address can be whitelisted
 - done

Time measured with blocks instead of timestamps
 - TODO From what I read about timestamps, it sounded like they’re more accurate than block numbers *unless they’re being purposefully manipulated*, which I was treating as a more important risk than the relative certainty that our 24 hours could be off by ~10%? Please ask Zeppelin about this issue.

Unnecessary INITIAL_SUPPLY variable
 - done

We suggest adding an event...
 - done

For clarity, consider moving the casts...
 - done

Consider adding a parametrized isAdmin...
 - done (sort of - added an onlyAdmin modifier, but not sure that a parametrized isAdmin really helps because there's parallelism with the deferBlock check and putting them *both* into the function signatures would make those really bloated)

The changeWhiteList function...
 - done

By extending OpenZeppelin’s MintableToken...
 - done

In the requestMint function...
 - done
